---------------------------------------------------
Using the Extension:
1. Go to any website with a password field.
   - For example: Gmail signup, Twitter signup/login, or any form asking for a password.

2. Start typing a password.
   - A small popup box will appear just below the password field.
   - The box shows:
     * Password Strength -> Weak / Okay / Strong (with a colored bar).
     * Breach Check -> Tells if your password was found in leaked databases.
     * Improvement Tips -> Suggestions like "Add uppercase" or "Use 12+ characters."
     * Password Suggestions -> 3 strong alternatives you can directly use.

3. Swap to a Stronger Password.
   - Next to each suggestion, thereâ€™s a Swap button.
   - Click it -> Your typed password will be replaced by that strong suggestion.

   - If you want new ideas, click the Regenerate Suggestions button.
   - The extension will create fresh strong passwords.

5. Focus & Blur Behavior.
   - The popup appears when you type in a password field.
   - It disappears when you click outside or move to another field.

---------------------------------------------------
Privacy Notes:
- The extension never sends your full password anywhere.
- It only sends the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash to the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API.
- This ensures your actual password remains private.
